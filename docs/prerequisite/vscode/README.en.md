You are allowed to use any of your favorite IDEs. However, as [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) has been very popular for general cloud development, we recommend using VSCode as the primary IDE for this workshop.

If you prefer cloud IDEs with VSCode experience, [Github Codespaces](https://github.com/features/codespaces) or [Gitpod](https://www.gitpod.io/) is recommended.
