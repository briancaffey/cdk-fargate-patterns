# Modern Application with Serverless Containers

**Modern Application with Serverless Containers** is an AWS Solution that allows you to deploy applications with serverless containers from local development environment to AWS with high level AWS CDK constructs. As a developer, you have the freedom to use or extend the provided constructs in your CDK application to simplify the application deployment without managing the AWS infrastructure.


In this workshop, we'll walk you through building the following patterns with multiple services running with both external and internal load balancers on AWS.
