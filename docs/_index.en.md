# App Modernization with Serverless Containers

**App Modernization with Serverless Containers** is an AWS solution built with patterns that allows you to deploy modern applications with serverless containers from local development environment to AWS. As a developer, you have the freedom to use or extend the provided constructs in your CDK application to streamline the application deployment without managing the complexity from the underlying infrastructure.


In this workshop, we'll walk you through building the following patterns with single or multiple services running with both external and internal load balancers on AWS.
