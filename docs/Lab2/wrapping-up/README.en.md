Congratulations! Now we've learned how to develop and test multiple microservices locally and deploy all of them to AWS Fargate in a single deployment straight from our IDE.

With this pattern, you are allowed to deploy any of your applications or services from your IDE. You don't have to define your infrastructure, instead, the `DualAlbFargateService` automatically provisions required infrastructure and resources such as IAM policies, security groups as well as external and internal load balancers and brings up your services with them.

In the next Lab, we will go through some advanced topics in real world production environment. Let's go to the next Lab.
